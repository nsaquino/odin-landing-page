# Project: Landing Page
This is the second project from the Foundations section of The Odin Project. The aim of this project is to make an entire web page using the basic knowledge acquired of both CSS and HTML. With this project, I will have demonstrated that I am capable of:
* creating a new web page from scratch and adding the page's contents using HTML.
* formatting the structure of the web page using HTML.
* editing the way the different elements look using CSS.
* changing how the different elements are arranged in the web page using CSS.
* understanding and taking advantage of the block model to correctly position the elements on the web page.
* utilizing Flexbox's properties to shape and position the elements on the web page.
